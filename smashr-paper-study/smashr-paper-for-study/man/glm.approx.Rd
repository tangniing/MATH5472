\usage{
glm.approx(
  x,
  g = NULL,
  minobs = 1,
  pseudocounts = 0.5,
  all = FALSE,
  eps = 1e-08,
  center = FALSE,
  repara = FALSE,
  forcebin = FALSE,
  lm.approx = FALSE,
  disp = c("add", "mult"),
  bound = 0.02
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A matrix of N (# of samples) by 2*B (B: # of WCs or, more
precisely, of different scales and locations in multi-scale space);
Two consecutive columns correspond to a particular scale and
location; The first column (the second column) contains # of
successes (# of failures) for each sample at the corresponding
scale and location.}

\item{g}{A vector of covariate values. Can be a factor (2 groups
only) or quantitative. For a 2-group categorical covariate, provide
\code{g} as a 0-1 factor instead of a 0-1 numeric vector for faster
computation.}

\item{minobs}{Minimum number of non-zero required for each model to
be fitted (otherwise NA is returned for that model).}

\item{pseudocounts}{A number to be added to counts when counts are
zero (or possibly extremely small).}

\item{all}{Bool, if TRUE pseudocounts are added to all entries, if
FALSE (default) pseudocounts are added only to cases when either
number of successes or number of failures (but not both) is 0.}

\item{center}{Bool, indicating whether to center \code{g}. If
\code{g} is a 2-group categorical variable and centering is
desired, use \code{center=TRUE} instead of treating \code{g} as
numeric and centering manually to avoid slower computation.}

\item{repara}{Bool, indicating whether to reparameterize
\code{alpha} and \code{beta} so that their likelihoods can be
factorized.}

\item{forcebin}{Bool, if TRUE don't allow for
overdipersion. Defaults to TRUE if \code{nsig=1}, and FALSE
otherwise.}

\item{lm.approx}{Bool, indicating whether a WLS alternative should
be used. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{disp}{A string, can be either "add" or "mult", indicating the
form of overdispersion assumed when \code{lm.approx=TRUE}.}

\item{bound}{Numeric, indicates the threshold of the success vs
failure ratio below which pseudocounts will be added.}
}
\value{
A matrix of 2 (or 5 if g is provided) by T (# of WCs); Each
  row contains alphahat (1st row), standard error of alphahat (2nd),
  betahat (3rd), standard error of betahat (4th), covariance between
  alphahat and betahat (5th) for each WC.
}
\description{
Fit the model specified in documentation, using either
  a weighted least squares approach or a generalized linear model
  approach, with some modifications. This function fits many "simple"
  logistic regressions (ie zero or one covariate) simultaneously,
  allowing for the possibility of small sample sizes with low or zero
  counts. In addition, an alternative model in the form of a weighted
  least squares regression can also be fit in place of a logistic
  regression.
