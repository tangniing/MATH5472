\title{smashr: Smoothing using Adaptive SHrinkage in R}
\description{
This package performs nonparametric regression on
  univariate Poisson or Gaussian data using multi-scale methods. For
  the Poisson case, the data \eqn{x} is a vector, with \eqn{x_j \sim
  Poi(\mu_j)} where the mean vector \eqn{\mu} is to be estimated.
  For the Gaussian case, the data \eqn{x} are a vector with \eqn{x_j
  \sim N(\mu_j, \sigma^2_j)}. Where the mean vector \eqn{\mu} and
  variance vector \eqn{\sigma^2} are to be estimated. The primary
  assumption is that \eqn{\mu} is spatially structured, so \eqn{\mu_j
  - \mu_{j+1}} will often be small (that is, roughly, \eqn{\mu} is
  smooth). Also \eqn{\sigma} is spatially structured in the Gaussian
  case (or, optionally, \eqn{\sigma} is constant, not depending on
  \eqn{j}).

\details{
The function \code{\link{smash}} provides a minimal
  interface to perform simple smoothing.  It is actually a wrapper to
  \code{\link{smash.gaus}} and \code{\link{smash.poiss}} which
  provide more options for advanced use.  The only required input is
  a vector of length 2^J for some integer J.  Other options include
  the possibility of returning the posterior variances, specifying a
  wavelet basis (default is Haar, which performs well in general due
  to the fact that smash uses the translation-invariant transform)
