# MATH5472
This final project is focus on paper "Flexible Signal Denoising via Flexible Empirical Bayes Shrinkage".

Before implement R code, please install some package follow next steps:

	install.packages("devtools")
	library(devtools)
	install_github("stephenslab/smashr")

1. smashr-paper is the original code package from Matthew Stephens's lab.
    (https://github.com/stephenslab/smashr/tree/master)

2. gauss.R: use smash method to smoothing signal with Gaussion noise.

3. poisson.R: use smash method to smoothing signal with Possion noise.

And I must mention that the "smashr" package is truly comprehensive and highly efficient. Bravo!
